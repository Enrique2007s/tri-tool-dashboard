# tri-tool-dashboard

Welcome to Tri-Tool Dashboard. Tri-Tool-Dashboard is a site that enables users to be more effective and organized throughout their day. The site hopes to help users who need quick and small tools in a fast manner. By combining these three tools in one website, users can quickly navigate between tasks, a timer, and a unit conversion. This will be useful to all visitors as they will be able to manage their tasks in an efficient manner with a timer by their side. If they need conversions, we have a section for that too.

Currently it seems quite empty. But do not worry. As time passes, more and more features will be implemented onto the site. It will go from Tri-Tool-Dashboard to Deca-Tool-Dashboard. An amazing new name!

## Features

### Home Page / Dashboard

*  The Home Page or Dashboard is the place users will first arrive when entering the site. This page contains the title (name of the website), the page description (inside the gray container), and three buttons which will take you to three different parts of the website.

- This is of importance to the user because it is the most useful part of a the website. It presents the user with three choices for navigation, each taking the visitor to their desired destination.

### Task Manager

* The Task Manager is the button to the right (green). It is the section where users will create their tasks. Once a task is entered, on the left the text for the task will be displayed, while on the right there will be a delete button.

- This is the part of the page where users will be able to write down their tasks. It is of importance because it will allow the user to keep track of their to-do list and not forget any important details.

### Unit Converter

* The Unit converter is the button in the middle (blue). It takes you to the Unit Converter section. In this section, the user will encounter three blue boxes each having its own conversion. Distance(KM-MI), Volume(Li-Gal), and Temperatures(C, F, and K).

- It is of importance to the user because it allows quick conversions between the most used metric systems.

### Timer

* The timer is the button to the right (red). This button takes the user to the Timer page. Here, the user will have a timer to help keep track of how much time is spent on each task.

- It is of importance because it helps the user know how much time has passed, or how much time has been spent working on a task needed to be finished.
